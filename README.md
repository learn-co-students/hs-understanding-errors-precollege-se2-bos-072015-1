## Reading Errors and Diagnosing Problems with your Code

One of the most important skills any developer needs is the ability to read and understand errors in order to fix oriblems with a codebase. Every single developer that has ever existed - from Steve Wozniak to Mark Zuckerberg to Larry Page - has encountered errors in their code and had to work to fix them.

Sometimes errors can take 30 seconds to fix. More serious bugs can take weeks. The key is perseverence, keeping your cool, paying attention to error messages, and a high tolerance for frustration. This lab is designed to introduce you to some common syntax errors and get you comfortable with reading and interpreting error messages.
